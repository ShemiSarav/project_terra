# Risk Register

## 1. Introduction
- Purpose of the Risk Register: document, assess, and mitigate risks aligned with Arbiter’s ethical oversight and the UN Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework as per ISO 31000 guidelines.[^1]  
- This register follows the JIU 2020 review on ERM in the UN system, ensuring a systematic, organization-wide approach to risk management.[^2]

## 2. Risk Identification
- Method for identifying risks: combination of brainstorming sessions, scenario modeling, and stakeholder interviews, following UNICEF’s ERM audit recommendations.[^3]  
- Risks are categorized per UN guidelines:  
  - **Strategic Risks:** e.g., mission drift or misalignment with Providence tenets.[^4]  
  - **Operational Risks:** e.g., technical failure of Nexus modules or Arbiter audit logs compromise.[^5]  
  - **Financial Risks:** e.g., insufficient funding or currency fluctuations jeopardizing pilot launch.[^6]  
  - **Compliance & Legal Risks:** e.g., GDPR/CCPA violations in data handling.[^7]  
  - **Reputational Risks:** e.g., community backlash from misunderstood pilot outcomes.[^8]

## 4. Risk Levels Definitions
- **Likelihood:** Probability of occurrence (High, Medium, Low), per UNICEF’s ERM audit guidelines.[^9]  
- **Impact:** Severity if risk occurs (High, Medium, Low), aligned with ISO 31000:2018 guidance.[^10]  
- **Rating:** Combined score guiding prioritization; calculated via a standard UN risk matrix (Likelihood × Impact).[ ^11 ]

## 5. Mitigation Plans
- **R001:** AES-256 encryption; segment data by access level; quarterly third-party privacy audit.[^12]  
- **R002:** Host joint governance workshops; provide transparency reports; monitor stakeholder feedback continually.[^13]  
- **R003:** Create a dedicated fundraising task force; pursue UNDP and EU grants per UN country-level risk guidelines.[^14]  
- **R004:** Build an AI ethics board review panel; enforce data-use policies with real-time monitoring; conduct developer training on ethical coding.[^15]  
- **R005:** Adopt ISO 31000 lifecycle planning; schedule biannual technical reviews; maintain spare-parts inventory for critical Nexus modules.[^16]

## 6. Monitoring & Reporting
- Monthly risk review meetings chaired by the Risk Owner, following UNICEF’s ERM best practices for meeting cadence.[^17]  
- Quarterly risk reports submitted to the Steering Committee and Advisory Board, as recommended by UN CEB risk guidelines.[^18]  
- Criteria for escalation: if a risk rating becomes “High” for two consecutive months, activate an emergency response protocol.[^19]

## 7. Continuous Improvement
- Process for adding new risks: solicit input from all Working Groups via a standardized risk-submission form, per ISO 31000 continuous improvement cycle.[^20]  
- Document lessons learned after each mitigation cycle; publish updates in a living risk log following UNICEF’s transparency model.[^21]

#### Guidance Notes
- **Risk ID:** Use a simple incremental scheme to ensure every risk is uniquely identifiable.[^15]  
- **Likelihood & Impact Scoring:** For consistency, adopt the UN’s numerical thresholds (H = 0.6–1.0; M = 0.3–0.59; L = 0–0.29) aligned with ISO 31000:2018 guidance.[^16]  
- **Current Controls:** Document existing safeguards, referencing UNHCR and UNICEF risk audit examples where encryption, access control, and monitoring logs are mandatory.[^17]  
- **Mitigation Actions:** Use SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) to define actions as recommended by UN ERM best practices.[^18]  
- **Risk Owner:** Assign a clear owner to ensure accountability, as recommended by ISO 31000 and UN policy.[^19]
