# Project Terra – Adaptation Template for Local Implementation

## Purpose

This document provides a structured adaptation pathway for deploying Project Terra in diverse geopolitical, cultural, and infrastructural environments—while preserving the integrity of the Trilayer Protocol.

## 1. Core Principles (Non-Negotiable)

These foundational tenets must remain intact in any local adaptation:

- Human dignity is supreme
- Voluntary participation and consent are mandatory
- Arbiter must remain auditable and override-capable
- No implementation shall operate in secrecy, coercion, or surveillance beyond consent
- The Trilayer balance (Providence/Nexus/Arbiter) must be preserved

## 2. Adaptation Worksheet (Per Region)

| Field                          | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Region / Locale               | Insert target region name                                                  |
| Lead Implementers             | Local governance or NGO partners                                           |
| Legal Adjustments Needed      | Identify deviations from GDPR, HIPAA, or other frameworks                  |
| Cultural Considerations       | Religious, linguistic, or historical factors influencing adoption          |
| Localization Actions          | Translation, iconography, storytelling adaptations                         |
| Technology Constraints        | Connectivity, hardware, or energy limitations                              |
| Risk Modifications            | Any region-specific risks requiring tailored mitigation                    |
| Local Metrics & KPIs          | Specific indicators for impact tracking (aligned to global KPI scaffold)   |
| Operative Conditions          | Community readiness, operative mental health, training needs               |
| Review Cadence                | Frequency of ethics re-alignment and feedback loop                         |

## 3. Implementation Phases

1. **Discovery**: Engage local stakeholders, map cultural constraints
2. **Alignment**: Filter regional plans through Arbiter's ethical scaffold
3. **Pilot**: Deploy a limited-scope Repair Zone or TerraStack module
4. **Audit**: Conduct multi-lens review (ethical, operational, cultural)
5. **Scale**: Expand validated protocols with localized enhancements

## 4. Recommended Tools

- Use `glossary.md` to localize key terms with accurate metaphors
- Follow `data_governance.md` for tailoring consent + ownership policies
- Translate executive summary + KPI targets into native languages

## 5. Escalation Policy

If local adaptation pressures threaten to distort core values:
- Flag immediately via Arbiter override
- Suspend implementation
- Trigger Providence Re-Center Protocol with global advisory review

*Adaptation is not dilution. It is resonance. Terra does not spread by force—it grows by harmonic alignment with the dignity inherent in every culture.*
