# Data Governance Charter

## 1. Introduction
- Purpose of data governance within Project Terra.  
- Alignment with Providence’s ethical principles, modeled on the UN System-wide “Principles on Personal Data Protection and Privacy.”  
  (See https://unsdg.un.org/resources/policies-guidance-principles-personal-data-protection-and-privacy for reference).

## 2. Scope
- Types of data covered (personal data, operational data, analytics).  
- Systems and platforms included (Nexus user data, Arbiter legal logs, community surveys).

## 3. Data Ownership & Stewardship
### 3.1 Data Owners
- Roles responsible for different data domains (e.g., Nexus data owned by Technical Lead; Arbiter logs owned by Ethics Lead).  
- Responsibilities of data owners: ensure compliance, approve data-sharing requests, maintain documentation.

### 3.2 Data Stewards
- Roles responsible for data quality, documentation, and lifecycle (e.g., assigned stewards for each dataset).  
- Duties: validate accuracy, enforce retention policies, oversee archival and deletion processes.

## 4. Data Privacy & Consent
- Privacy principles based on UNSDG “Big-Data Guidance Note” (informed consent, proportionality, “do-no-harm”).  
- Informed consent protocols: explicit opt-in forms, clear purpose statements, easy opt-out mechanism.  
- Data minimization and purpose limitation: collect only what’s necessary for Nexus analytics or Arbiter auditing.

## 5. Data Security & Access Control
### 5.1 Authentication & Authorization
- User roles and permissions (e.g., system admins, data stewards, auditors).  
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) required for all privileged accounts.

### 5.2 Encryption & Secure Storage
- AES-256 encryption for data at rest.  
- TLS 1.3 for data in transit.

### 5.3 Audit Logging
- Logging requirements for data access and modifications.  
- Retention period for logs: minimum 2 years.

## 6. Data Quality & Integrity
- Quality metrics: accuracy, completeness, consistency.  
- Validation and cleansing processes: automated scripts to detect anomalies; manual review by data stewards monthly.

## 7. Data Lifecycle Management
- Data retention policies: personal data retained only for 5 years after last user interaction.  
- Archival procedures: move inactive datasets to cold storage after 2 years.  
- Data deletion and anonymization protocols: secure deletion scripts; irreversible anonymization for analytic datasets.

## 8. Compliance & Legal Requirements
- Regulatory frameworks: GDPR (EU), CCPA (California).  
- Data subject rights: access, rectification, erasure, data portability.  
- Breach-notification timeline: notify affected subjects and regulators within 72 hours of discovery.

## 9. Data Governance Committee
- Roles and responsibilities:  
  - Data Governance Chair (oversees policy updates)  
  - Data Owners and Stewards (as defined in §3)  
  - Legal Advisor (ensures regulatory compliance)  
- Meeting frequency: monthly; ad hoc for breach investigations.

## 10. Incident Response & Breach Notification
- Procedures for detecting, reporting, and responding to data breaches.  
- Notification timelines:  
  - Initial internal alert within 24 hours of discovery.  
  - Notify data subjects and regulators within 72 hours.  
- Stakeholder communications: predefined templates for email and press statements.

## 11. Training & Awareness
- Mandatory training for all members handling data: annual privacy/security refresher.  
- Ongoing education: quarterly webinars on new regulations and best practices.

## 12. Review & Continuous Improvement
- Periodic audits: external audit every 12 months; internal review every 6 months.  
- Feedback loops: stakeholders submit improvement suggestions via online form; Data Governance Committee reviews monthly.
