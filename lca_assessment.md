# Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA)

## Purpose

This document outlines the environmental footprint and life-cycle considerations of technologies embedded within Project Terraâ€™s deployment stack, particularly those linked to Nexus systems and immersive hardware.

## 1. Scope of Assessment

This LCA focuses on:

- **Nexus Devices**: Modular civic terminals, data beacons
- **Haptic Interfaces**: Tactile AR gloves, wearable sensors
- **Distributed Sensors**: Environmental input nodes (air, noise, flow)

## 2. Materials & Sourcing

- Prioritize **conflict-free** minerals and **recyclable composites**
- Use **open hardware standards** to encourage community repairability
- Disclose and minimize reliance on rare-earth metals

## 3. Manufacturing & Assembly

- Contract partners that follow **ISO 14001** environmental standards
- Avoid carbon-intensive techniques where alternatives exist (e.g., CNC aluminum over injection-molded plastics)
- Encourage **local/regional fabrication** to reduce logistics emissions

## 4. Operational Energy Impact

- Favor **ARM-based processors** and edge computing for lower energy draw
- Devices must include **sleep cycles** and low-power fallback states
- Energy usage will be offset through renewable-energy credits where feasible

## 5. End-of-Life Protocol

- Devices are designed for **disassembly and part reusability**
- Return-to-repair incentives and a **device stewardship deposit**
- Non-recoverable units must follow **e-waste compliance** for jurisdiction

## 6. Reporting & Auditing

- LCA reports will be revisited every 18 months or after major hardware revision
- Reporting aligns with **UN Sustainable Development Goal 12** and ISO 14040 standards

## 7. Future Considerations

- Explore **biodegradable circuit substrates**
- Pilot **community e-labs** for device repair and upcycling
- Investigate partnership with organizations like **Fairphone**, **Framework**, or **Open Compute Project**

*Project Terra holds that technological progress without ecological responsibility is inherently unstable. This LCA exists to embed that accountability into our foundational blueprint.*
