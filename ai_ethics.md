# AI Ethics Toolkit – Project Terra

## Purpose

This toolkit operationalizes the Arbiter layer's ethical mandate within Project Terra. It ensures all AI, automation, and decision-support systems remain aligned with human dignity, legal frameworks, and planetary responsibility.

## 1. Foundation Standards

Project Terra’s ethics architecture draws from:

- **IEEE 7000 Series**: Ethical System Engineering
- **OECD AI Principles**: Human-centered, transparent, and accountable AI
- **Asilomar AI Guidelines**: Safety, transparency, value alignment
- **UNESCO AI Ethics Recommendations**
- **Project Terra's own Arbiter Protocol (see §6 in main guide)**

## 2. Pre-Deployment Ethical Checklist

All new systems or updates must pass:

- [ ] *Alignment Audit*: Purpose matches Providence's stated vision
- [ ] *Bias Review*: Datasets reviewed for systemic, historical, or algorithmic bias
- [ ] *Transparency Test*: Decision logic must be interpretable
- [ ] *Fail-Safe Integration*: All actions must route through Arbiter for override potential
- [ ] *Consent Traceability*: Any user interaction involving personal data must log consent trail
- [ ] *Minimum Ethical Viability (MEV)* score ≥ 0.85

## 3. Red Teaming & Scenario Simulation

Conduct at least **two ethical adversarial simulations** per release cycle:

- Simulate data poisoning, malicious prompt injection, or model drift
- Introduce conflicting values (e.g., cost vs. dignity)
- Use "Arbiter Override" protocol when misalignment is detected

## 4. Escalation Protocols

If any Arbiter trigger fails in simulation or field use:

- Log incident in immutable ledger
- Freeze all affected decision-making routines
- Notify Ethics Officer and independent advisory node
- Open a Root Cause Review (RCR) with multidisciplinary lens (AI, psych, civic design)

## 5. Approved Auditing Tools

Recommended open-source or hybrid tools:

- **Fairlearn** or **IBM AI Fairness 360**: Bias detection
- **DiCE / SHAP / LIME**: Explainability
- **WhyLogs + Evidently AI**: Drift detection
- **Ethical Stack Score (ESS)**: In-house metric scoring ethical loadout

## 6. Audit Trail & Public Logging

- All decisions affecting individuals or rights must be **recorded and hash-anchored**
- Periodic logs are made public for transparency
- Anonymization is mandatory for any user-identifiable data

## 7. Periodic Review

- Full ethical re-audit every **6 months**
- Emergency re-audit upon any high-severity override or operational failure
- Toolkit updated in sync with evolving AI/ethics standards

*Project Terra’s moral core is not theoretical—it is auditable, triggerable, and alive within Arbiter’s field logic.*
